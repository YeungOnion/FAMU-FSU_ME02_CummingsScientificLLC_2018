# FAMU-FSU_ME02_CummingsScientificLLC_2018
Relevant information, files, and code for the use of the testing rig designed by the FAMU-FSU ME Senior Design Team 02 working with Cummings Scientific LLC. 

> Cummings Scientific LLC (Cummings) is a team of forensic engineers and scientists who largely serve as expert witnesses in cases. They see hundreds of cases of low-speed ($<7$mph delta-V*) rear-end collisions where one party claims permanent or severe injury. Current methods of low-speed modeling include extrapolation from data from greater than 20mph delta-V. The goal of the project was to develop a model that was accurate in the low-speed regime that was validated with experimental data. The team designed an interchangeable bumper mount to test a variety of bumpers using the same vehicle. The use of the mount, as well as the repeated use of the vehicle were kept in mind as sources of error and for validation, the vehicle was impacted at a high-speed while using the bumper mount to ensure that the behavior was unchanged.

> *delta-V: the speed gained by impacted vehicle after collision, i.e. normalized impulse
